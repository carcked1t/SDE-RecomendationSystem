# Product Search & Recommendation System 

**Short description**

A beginner-friendly, resume-worthy demo project implementing a product search and recommendation backend with a small demo frontend. Built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic (v2) — includes search filtering, simple recommendations, caching, and click/view tracking.



## Key features (resume bullets)

- **FastAPI backend** with clean RESTful endpoints for product CRUD, search, analytics (views/clicks) and recommendations 
- **Search** supporting text queries and filters (category, price range, rating) with **case-insensitive** category matching 
- **Simple recommendation logic** (same category + price proximity) and a **popularity ranking** using rating × log(views) + clicks 
- **In-memory TTL cache** for search/popular responses to improve demo performance 
- **Frontend demo** (vanilla JS + static HTML) that calls the backend, hosted under `/demo` for convenience 
- **Pydantic v2**, SQLAlchemy ORM, migration-friendly structure — designed as a teaching/example project 
- **Unit test** demonstrating case-insensitive search behavior + simple smoke tests 



## Tech stack & design notes

- **Python 3.10+**, **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Pydantic v2**
- **SQLite** for easy local demo (recommend switching to **Postgres** for production)
- Simple, deterministic scoring for popularity and related items (easy to explain in interviews)
- Cache keys are normalized (case + whitespace) to ensure consistent behavior


## Quick run (local)

1. Create and activate a virtualenv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Seed the database:

```bash
python scripts/init_db.py
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

5. Open the demo: http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo or visit the OpenAPI docs at `/docs`.



## Tests

Run the unit tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The repo includes a targeted test that ensures category searches are case-insensitive.

## API summary (important endpoints)

- `POST /products/add` — Add a product
- `GET /products/search` — Search with `q`, `category`, `min_price`, `max_price`, `min_rating`, `sort_by`, `page`, `size`
- `GET /products/{id}` — Get product
- `GET /products/{id}/view` — Increment view counter (affects popularity)
- `GET /products/{id}/click` — Increment click counter
- `GET /recommend/{product_id}` — Related products (same category + price proximity)
- `GET /recommend/popular` — Popular products

> All search/category matching is case-insensitive and cache keys are normalized.
